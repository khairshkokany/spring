## LAB 11
1. Ensure that you can run the Spring app.
2. Create a hello world route at **/hello**, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered template come back.
3. Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit **/capitalize/hello** and get back an HTML page containing the response **HELLO** .
4. Create a basic **splash page** **(/)** for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
5. Create an Album class to act as a model in our app.
6. An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that albumâ€™s art.
6. Create a route at **/albums** that shows three album instances. (the output will be the title , artist and imageUrl )
